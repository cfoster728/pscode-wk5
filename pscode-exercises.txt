// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

set values for num1, num2
sum=num1+num2
   print sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

x = any number
set x

if == x/2
  print EVEN
all else
  print ODD

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.   


a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) set values num1, num2, num3, num4, num5
b) sum= [(num1,num2,num3,num4,sum5)/5] 
   print sum
c) set min = 0
   set max = 0
set x= num1 or num2 or num3 or num4 or num 5
   read x 
   compare x to min
   if x < min:
       min = x
   if x > max:
       max = x
print new min
print new max

d) print sum= [(num1,num2,num3,num4,sum5)/5] 
   print text = Calculating the average of 5 numbers when numbers are <br> print a

   print (c) new min, new max
   print text = Determine smallest and largest numbers of set of 5.
